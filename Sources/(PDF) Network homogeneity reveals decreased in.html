<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Examination of spontaneous intrinsic brain activity is drawing increasing interest, thus methods for such analyses are rapidly evolving. Here we describe a novel measure, &#34;network homogeneity&#34;, that allows for assessment of cohesiveness within a specified functional network, and apply it to resting-state fMRI data from adult ADHD and control participants. We examined the default mode network, a medial-wall based network characterized by high baseline activity that decreases during attention-demanding cognitive tasks. We found reduced network homogeneity within the default mode network in ADHD subjects compared to age-matched controls, particularly between the precuneus and other default mode network regions. This confirms previously published results using seed-based functional connectivity measures, and provides further evidence that altered precuneus connectivity is involved in the neuropathology of ADHD. Network homogeneity provides a potential alternative method for assessing functional connectivity of specific large-scale networks in clinical populations.</p>

<p>Altered Functional Brain Connectivity in a Non-Clinical Sample of Young Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity DisorderPaulo MattosJournal of Neuroscience, 2012
There is a growing consensus that ADHD is associated with abnormal function of diffuse brain networks, but such alterations remain poorly characterized. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, we characterized multivariate (complex network measures), bivariate (network-based statistic), and univariate (regional homogeneity) properties of brain networks in a non-clinical, drug-naive sample of high-functioning young men and women with ADHD (nine males, seven females) and a group of matched healthy controls. Data from our sample allowed the isolation of intrinsic functional connectivity alterations specific to ADHD diagnosis and symptoms that are not related to developmental delays, general cognitive dysfunction, or history of medication use. Multivariate results suggested that frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices were abnormally connected locally as well as with the rest of the brain in individuals with ADHD. Results from the network-based statistic supportandextendmultivariateresultsbyisolatingtwobrainnetworkscomprisingregionsbetweenwhichinter-regionalconnectivitywassignificantly alteredintheADHDgroup;namely,afrontalamygdala-occipitalnetworkandafrontaltemporal-occipitalnetwork.Brainbehaviorcorrelationsfurther highlightedthekeyroleofalteredorbitofrontal-temporalandfrontal-amygdalaconnectivityforsymptomsofinattentionandhyperactivity/impulsivity. All univariate properties were similar between groups. Taken together, results from this study show that the diagnosis and the two main symptom dimensions of ADHD are related to altered intrinsic connectivity in orbitofrontal-temporal-occipital and fronto-amygdala-occipital networks. Accordingly, our findings highlight the importance of extending the conceptualization of ADHD beyond segregated fronto-striatal alterations.

In recent years, a change in perspective in etiological models of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has occurred in concordance with emerging concepts in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. These models shift the focus of the assumed pathology from regional brain abnormalities to dysfunction in distributed network organization. In the current contribution, we report findings from functional connectivity studies during resting and task states, as well as from studies on structural connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging, in subjects with ADHD. Although major methodological limitations in analyzing connectivity measures derived from noninvasive in vivo neuroimaging still exist, there is convergent evidence for white matter pathology and disrupted anatomical connectivity in ADHD. In addition, dysfunctional connectivity during rest and during cognitive tasks has been demonstrated. However, the causality between disturbed white matter architecture and cortical dysfunction remains to be evaluated. Both genetic and environmental factors might contribute to disruptions in interactions between different brain regions. Stimulant medication not only modulates regionally specific activation strength but also normalizes dysfunctional connectivity, pointing to a predominant network dysfunction in ADHD. By combining a longitudinal approach with a systems perspective in ADHD in the future, it might be possible to identify at which stage during development disruptions in neural networks emerge and to delineate possible new endophenotypes of ADHD.

BackgroundAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental condition that often persists into adulthood with extensive negative consequences on quality of life. Despite emerging evidence indicating the genetic basis of ADHD, investigations into the familial expression of latent neurocognitive traits remain limited.MethodsIn a group of adult ADHD probands (n = 20), their unaffected first-degree relatives (n = 20) and typically developing control participants (n = 20), we assessed endophenotypic alterations in the default mode network (DMN) connectivity during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in relation to cognitive performance and clinical symptoms.

Notably, there is mounting evidence suggesting that ADHD could be regarded as a default mode network (DMN) disorder. In particular, failure in regulating the dynamics of activity and interactions of the DMN and cognitive control networks have been hypothesized as the main source of task interference causing attentional problems. On the other hand, previous studies indicated pronounced fluctuations in the strength of functional connections over time, particularly for the inter-network connections between the DMN and fronto-parietal control networks. Hence, characterization of connectivity disturbances in ADHD disorder requires a thorough assessment of time-varying FCs. In this study, we propose a dynamical systems perspective to assess how the DMN over time recruits different configurations of network segregation and integration. Specifically, we were interested ...

Intrinsic functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) of the brain has gained growing interest in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The DMN is proposed to support such core functions as theory of mind, self-related activities such as autobiographical self, stimulus independent thought, self-projection, self-reference, and introspective processes as well as central features of self-regulation, task compliance, and executive functions. Based on prior data showing that sLORETA and fMRI localize DMN regions with complementary accuracy, we hypothesized that this combination of methods could provide important information about the functional integrity of DMN connectivity with special attention between parietal and medial prefrontal regions. This study was conducted with 6 adults with ADHD and 7 age-similar, nonclinical controls. The present study recorded brain activity using both EEG and fMRI during rest and a Stroop paradigm. For this study only the eyes-opened rest data were analyzed using the sLORETA and fMRI psychophysiological interaction model respectively. sLORETA functional connectivity differences were assessed with Pearson&#39;s correlation measures and Fisher&#39;s Z test to examine the strength of the obtained coefficients between groups within the DMN. Differences in functional integrity of the DMN were found for most frequencies except theta, which did not show any difference between groups. Of interest, the ADHD group showed greater intrinsic functional connectivity in the alpha frequency range between medial prefrontal and left parietal regions. Functional connectivity within the DMN in both groups was comparable between both imaging modalities, with sLORETA providing evidence of the frequency-specific meaning of the associations. This study furthers the requisite for utilizing sLORETA in combination with fMRI to obtain knowledge of the connectivity in the context of EEG frequency-specific parameters. The study data offer preliminary evidence demonstrating the importance of left parieto-occipital regions to ADHD and potential neural resources that may be compromised in ADHD that are specifically involved in self-regulation, working memory, and executive functions.

The study of brain functional networks in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has provided useful information about the hyper-or hypo-connectivity between distinct brain regions. Nevertheless, the impact of negative links (antisynchrony) and their topology on the stability of the network still must be investigated. Methods: In this study, we hypothesized that the effect of dysconnectivity and antisynchrony should mainly be local and may not influence the overall stability and flexibility of the network in ADHD. Therefore, differences in brain functional organization of ADHD individuals were compared to a typically developed group using the structural balance theory. Results: Our results did not show any significant differences in the balance-energy of the resting-state network between healthy individuals and three subtypes of ADHD. However, a negative correlation was found between behavioral measures of ADHD and balance energy, highlighting that the higher disorder index may push the network to a less flexible (more balanced) state. Conclusion: We hope these findings enhance our understanding of the systemic mechanism behind ADHD.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, but there is no consensus regarding whether ADHD exists on the extreme end of a continuum of normal behavior or represents a discrete disorder. In this study, we sought to characterize both the categorical and dimensional variations in network functional connectivity in order to identify neural connectivity mechanisms of ADHD. Functional connectivity analyses of resting-state fMRI data from 155 children with ADHD and 145 typically developing children (TDC) defined the dorsal attention network (DA), default mode network (DM), salience processing network (SAL) and executive control network (CON). Regional alterations in connectivity associated with categorical diagnoses and dimensional symptom measures (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity) as well as their interaction were systematically characterized. Dimensional relationships between symptom severity measures and functional connectivity that did not differ between TDC and children with ADHD were observed for each network, supporting a dimensional characterization of ADHD. However, categorical differences in functional connectivity magnitude between TDC and children with ADHD were detected after accounting for dimensional relationships, indicating the existence of categorical mechanisms independent of dimensional effects. Additionally, differential dimensional relationships for TDC versus ADHD children demonstrated categorical differences in brain-behavior relationships. The patterns of network functional organization associated with categorical versus dimensional measures of ADHD accentuate the complexity of this disorder and support a dual characterization of ADHD etiology featuring both dimensional and categorical mechanisms.

Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a serious and frequent psychiatric disorder of multifactorial pathogenesis. Several lines of evidence support the idea that ADHD is, in its core, a disorder of dysfunctional brain connectivity within and between several neurofunctional networks. The primary aim of this study was to investigate associations between the functional connectivity within resting state brain networks and the individual severity of core ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity).

Graph description measures may be useful as predictor variables in classification procedures. Here, we consider several centrality measures as predictor features in a classification algorithm to identify nodes of resting-state networks containing predictive information that can discriminate between typical developing children and patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The prediction was based on a support vector machines classifier. The analyses were performed in a multisite and publicly available resting-state fMRI dataset of healthy children and ADHD patients: the ADHD-200 database. Network centrality measures contained little predictive information for the discrimination between ADHD patients and healthy subjects. However, the classification between inattentive and combined ADHD subtypes was more promising, achieving accuracies higher than 65% (balance between sensitivity and specificity) in some sites. Finally, brain regions were ranked according to the amount of discriminant information and the most relevant were mapped. As hypothesized, we found that brain regions in motor, frontoparietal, and default mode networks contained the most predictive information. We concluded that the functional connectivity estimations are strongly dependent on the sample characteristics. Thus different acquisition protocols and clinical heterogeneity decrease the predictive values of the graph descriptors.

Objective: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent and impairing neurodevelopmental disorder. While early childhood is a crucial time for early intervention, it is characterized by instability of ADHD diagnosis. Neural correlates of ADHD have potential to improve diagnostic accuracy; however, minimal research has focused on early childhood. Research indicates that disrupted neural connectivity is associated with ADHD in older children. Here, we explore network connectivity as a potential neural correlate of ADHD diagnosis in early childhood. Method: We collected EEG data in 52 medication-naïve children with ADHD and in 77 typically developing controls (3-7 years). Data was collected with the EGI 128 HydroCel Sensor Net System, but to optimize the ICA, the data was down sampled to the 10-10 system. Connectivity was measured as the synchronization of the time series of each pair of electrodes. Subsequent analyses utilized graph theoretical methods to further characterize network connectivity. Results: Increased global efficiency, which measures the efficiency of information transfer across the entire brain, was associated with increased inattentive symptom severity. Further, this association was robust to controls for age, IQ, SES, and internalizing psychopathology. Conclusions: Overall, our findings indicate that increased global efficiency, which suggests a hyper-connected neural network, is associated with elevated ADHD symptom severity. These findings extend previous work reporting disruption of neural network connectivity in older children with ADHD into early childhood.

<p>Characterising resting-state functional connectivity in a large sample of adults with ADHDCornelis C KanProgress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry, 2016
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood psychiatric disorder that often persists into adulthood. While several studies have identified altered functional connectivity in brain networks during rest in children with ADHD, few studies have been performed on adults with ADHD. Existing studies have generally investigated small samples. We therefore investigated aberrant functional connectivity in a large sample of adult patients with childhood-onset ADHD, using a data-driven, whole-brain approach. Adults with a clinical ADHD diagnosis (N = 99) and healthy, adult comparison subjects (N = 113) underwent a 9-minute restingstate fMRI session in a 1.5 T MRI scanner. After elaborate preprocessing including a thorough head-motion correction procedure, group independent component analysis (ICA) was applied from which we identified six networks of interest: cerebellum, executive control, left and right frontoparietal and two default-mode networks. Participant-level network maps were obtained using dual-regression and tested for differences between patients with ADHD and controls using permutation testing. Patients showed significantly stronger connectivity in the anterior cingulate gyrus of the executive control network. Trends were also observed for stronger connectivity in the cerebellum network in ADHD patients compared to controls. However, there was considerable overlap in connectivity values between patients and controls, leading to relatively low effect sizes despite the large sample size. These effect sizes were slightly larger when testing for correlations between hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms and connectivity strength in the executive control and cerebellum networks. This study provides important insights for studies on the neurobiology of adult ADHD; it shows that resting-state functional connectivity differences between adult patients and controls exist, but have smaller effect sizes than existing literature suggested.

Background-Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a major public health concern. It has been suggested that the brain&#39;s default network may provide a crucial avenue for understanding the neurobiology of ADHD. Evaluations of the default network have increased over recent years with the applied technique of resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). These investigations have established that spontaneous activity in this network is highly correlated at rest in young adult populations. This coherence seems to be reduced in adults with ADHD. This is an intriguing finding, as coherence in spontaneous activity within the default network strengthens with age. Thus, the pathophysiology of ADHD might include delayed or disrupted maturation of the default network. If so, it is important to determine whether an altered developmental picture can be detected using rs-fcMRI in children with ADHD.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is a novel approach that has the potential to examine abnormalities in the default mode network (DMN) component. Two different approaches were used in the present study to characterize the functional connectivities of various DMN components in 16 non-medicated ADHD and a similar number of TD (typically developing) children. rsfMRI data were analysed using independent component analysis (ICA) and region-of-interest (ROI) seed to voxel correlation analysis. ICA results indicated a strong coherence of the left dorsal anterior cingular cortex (dACC) with the DMN components in children with ADHD. In addition, seed-to-voxel functional connectivity analysis using the left dorsal anterior cingulate as a seed region suggested higher temporal coherence with other neural networks upon comparison with TD children. These results imply children with ADHD exhibit a higher dispersed resting state connectivity pattern in DMN and other networks.

In this study, we aim to determine the disrupted dynamic functional network connectivity differences in adult, adolescent, and child ADHD using restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data consisting of 35 children (8.64 ± 0.81 years), 40 adolescents (14.11 ± 1.83 years), and 39 adults (31.59 ± 10.13 years). We hypothesized that functional connectivity is time-varying and that there are within-and between-network connectivity differences among the three age groups. Nine functional networks were identified using group ICA, and three FC-states were recognized based on their dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) pattern. Fraction of time, mean dwell time, transition probability, degree-in, and degree-out were calculated to measure the state dynamics. Higher-order networks including the DMN, SN, and FPN, and lower-order networks comprising the SMN, VN, SC, and AUD were frequently distributed across all states and were found to show connectivity differences among the three age groups. Our findings imply abnormal dynamic interactions and dysconnectivity associated with different ADHD, and these abnormalities differ between the three ADHD age groups. Given the dFNC differences between the three groups in the current study, our work further provides new insights into the mechanism subserved by age difference in the pathophysiology of ADHD and may set the grounds for future case-control studies in the individual age groups, as well as serving as a guide in the development of treatment strategies to target these specific networks in each age group.

This perspective may provide clues to mechanisms of treatment response in psychiatric conditions. Here we examine functional brain community topology based on resting-state fMRI in adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; n = 22) and controls (n = 31). We sought to evaluate ADHD patterns in adulthood and their modification by short term stimulants administration. Participants with ADHD were scanned one or two weeks apart, once with medication and once without; comparison participants were scanned at one time-point. Functional connectivity was estimated from these scans and community detection applied to determine cortical network topology. Measures of change in connectivity profile were calculated via a graph measure, termed the Node Dissociation Index (NDI). Compared to controls, several cortical networks h...

The goal of the present study is to propose the use of global connectivity measures as quantitative indicators of long-term medication in pediatric patients with Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder, combined type (ADHD-C). For this purpose, graph theoretical brain connectivity indices are computed from connectivity estimations across eyes-opened resting-state EEG recordings measured before and after the treatment with osmotic release oral system-methylphenidate for a month in 18 boys (aged between 7–12 years). In order to present the reliable results, neurofunctional correlations are firstly estimated in time (Pearson Correlation (PC), Spearman Correlation), frequency (Directed Transfer Function, Partial Directed Coherence) and phase (Phase Locking Value, Phase Lag Index) domains in between short segments of 2 sec over single trials of 1 min. Later, transitivity, clustering coefficients, assortativity, global efficiency and modularity are computed from EEG based connectivity matrices produced by each approach. Since the highest classification accuracy of 83.79% is provided by PC, statistical tests (one-way Anova, pair-wise multiple comparison) and step-wise logistic regression modelling are all examined to detect significant differences between pre- and post- treatment relevant connectivity measures. Statistical boxplots are also shown, as well. Overall results reveal that global brain connectivity can be increased by long-term medication in pediatric ADHD-C in terms of increased segregation &amp; resilience. This is the first study to demonstrate that long-term medication can normalize the functional brain connectivity in ADHD, which is characterized by decreased connectivity compared to controls

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental psychiatric disorder thought to affect approximately 5 to 10% of school-age children, of whom 30 to 65% continue to exhibit symptoms into adulthood. The prevalence of ADHD in adults is also an estimated 4%, second only to depression. Across studies there appear to be significant network dysfunctions involved in ADHD. Typically the foci of interest in ADHD included the insular cortices, frontal lobes, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. More recently, attention has been directed to the default network of the brain and its functional integrity in ADHD with focus on the precuneus and parietal lobes and interactions with medial prefrontal cortices. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures neurovascular coupling as measured by the blood oxygenated level dependent signal (BOLD). Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures brain electrical information. Because fMRI is an indirect measure of neuronal activity and EEG is a direct measure, combining the results from these two imaging modalities under the same task conditions may provide a more complete story as to the what (EEG) and where (fMRI) activity exists. This article discusses the benefits of using standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) analysis of the EEG as compared to fMRI. The goal of the study, the data from which we use for our justification, was to discover the functional differences in ADHD and non-ADHD brains with different brain imaging modalities. We hoped to elucidate functional connectivity patterns by interpreting the data acquired with the EEG using sLORETA and the data acquired with the fMRI scans. We further hoped to find correlation with the sLORETA and fMRI interpretations so as to confirm that EEG is an adequate stand-alone methodology to evaluate ADHD. Participants included 6 ADHD and 7 non-ADHD subjects. They were initially interviewed by phone and administered the Connors Rating Scale and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview to determine accuracy of symptom reporting and to rule out psychological comorbidities. Exclusion criteria consisted of previous head trauma, recent drug or alcohol abuse (14 days), or neurological syndromes. We recorded sequential 19-channel EEG and fMRI during the eyes-open and eyes-closed states and while performing the Stroop test. The QEEG results were evaluated with comparison to a normative database and with sLORETA analysis.

The trajectory of neurodevelopmental adversity determining attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) from childhood to adulthood which is recognized increasingly by the long-term impairment and the burgeoning persistence beyond childhood, through adolescence, to adulthood poses a prolonged history defined by a concatenation of symptom profiles and an underlying dysregulation accompanied by aberrant brain regional networks. Abnormalities within the &#34;default mode network&#34; and disharmonizing fluctuations afflicting brain regional connectivity, even inducing dysconnectivity, appear to be associated both with symptoms profiles and the relative efficacy of putative interventional outcomes. Co-morbidity in ADHD, a persistently debilitating and potentially regressive issue, is viewed from a perspective of eating disorders and substance use disorders although several other combinations proliferate. Among the factors contributing to dysregulation and aberrant connectivity in brain development are included genetic and epigenetic proclivities, neurotoxins and neurodegeneration, predisposing characteristics and environmental pressures. Finally, the likelihood of perinatal stress trauma and/or inflammation as contributory circumstances ought to be considered. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) prevalence appears, by most current accounts, to be steadily increasing, possibly due to greater diagnostic, parental and teacher awareness but also to the interactive effects of environmental stressors, chemical agents and a generally disharmonious and unhealthy lifestyles that major portions of the populations have adopted (Archer et al., 2011).[1] In many respects, the burgeoning incidence of ADHD and accompanying health problems is alarming (Archer and Garcia, 2016),[2] despite the inroads that have been made pertaining to intervention (Archer and Kostrzewa, 2012)[3]. ADHD symptom profiles vary between children, adolescents and adults but basically incorporate an exaggerated level of impulsiveness, lack of attention and a high degree of distractibility, excessive thoughtlessness and forgetfulness, losing things and disability in &#39;starting-and-finishing&#39; (Archer and Garcia, 2016)[2], as well as alterations of the processes determining decision-making and reinforcement learning. ADHD pathophysiology incorporates a concatenation of multiple, cohesive modality spanning deficits, with each deficit expressing marked spatial overlap within patterns of structural and functional dysregulation (Kessler et al., 2014; Metin et al., 2015)[4,5]. A growing consensus indicates that as &#39;part-and-parcel&#39; to the ADHD condition impairments, the default network-ventral attention network interconnections, or dysconnections, present a key locus of dysfunction and neurodevelopmental derangement (Sripada et al., 2014a,b).[6] Kessler et al. (2016)[7a,ab] have identified parallel associations between intrinsic connectivity networks dysmaturation and ADHD diagnosis in a sample of youths. They observed a pattern depicting a consistent biomarker for severe attentional performance deficits concurrent with a &#39;down-shifted&#39; expression of intrinsic connectivity network maturation, i.e. shallow maturation, as opposed to a right-shifted expression, i.e. &#39;lagged&#39; maturation. ADHD children and adolescents demonstrated markedly reduced dorsal caudate functional connectivity with the superior and middle prefrontal cortices as well as reduced dorsal putamen connectivity with the parahippocampal cortex (Hong et al., 2015). [8] Estimations of connectivity correlated in diametrically opposite directions among the ADHD and healthy control individuals, respectively, through the assessment attentional performance by application of the Continuous Performance Test, despite a good response to methylphenidate. Remarkably, it seems the case that studies carried out on ADHD patients to a major extent target upon dopaminergic genes and the structure of basal ganglia using structural and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI and fMRI) (Vilor-Tejedor et al., 2016).[9]

Eigenvector-Centrality (EC) has shown promising results in the field of Psychiatry, with early results also pertaining to ADHD. Parallel efforts have focused on the description of aberrant interhemispheric coordination in ADHD, as measured by Voxel-Mirrored-Homotopic-Connectivity (VMHC), with early evidence of altered Resting-State fMRI. A sample was collected from the ADHD200-NYU initiative: 86 neurotypicals and 89 participants with ADHD between 7 and 18 years old were included after quality control for motion. After preprocessing, voxel-wise EC and VMHC values between diagnostic groups were compared, and network-level values from 15 functional networks extracted. Age, ADHD severity (Connor&#39;s Parent Rating-Scale), IQ (Wechsler-Abbreviated-Scale), and right-hand dominance were correlated with EC/VMHC values in the whole sample and within groups, both at the voxel-wise and network-level. Motion was controlled by censoring timepoints with Framewise-Displacement &gt; 0.5 mm, as well as controlling for group differences in mean Framewise-Displacement values. EC was significantly higher in ADHD compared to neurotypicals in the left inferior Frontal lobe, Lingual gyri, Peri-Calcarine cortex, superior and middle Occipital lobes, right inferior Occipital lobe, right middle Temporal gyrus, Fusiform gyri, bilateral Cuneus, right Precuneus, and Cerebellum (FDR-corrected-p = 0.05). No differences were observed between groups in voxel-wise VMHC. EC was positively correlated with ADHD severity scores at the network level (at p-value &lt; 0.01, Inattentive: Cerebellum rho = 0.273; Hyper/Impulsive: High-Visual Network rho = 0.242, Cerebellum rho = 0.273; Global Index Severity: High-Visual Network rho = 0.241, Cerebellum rho = 0.293). No differences were observed between groups for motion (p = 0.443). While EC was more related to ADHD psychopathology, VMHC was consistently and negatively correlated with age across all networks.

<p>Using spatial multiple regression to identify intrinsic connectivity networks involved in working memory performanceEvan GordonHuman Brain Mapping, 2012
Many researchers have noted that the functional architecture of the human brain is relatively invariant during task performance and the resting state. Indeed, intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) revealed by resting-state functional connectivity analyses are spatially similar to regions activated during cognitive tasks. This suggests that patterns of task-related activation in individual subjects may result from the engagement of one or more of these ICNs; however, this has not been tested. We used a novel analysis, spatial multiple regression, to test whether the patterns of activation during an N-back working memory task could be well described by a linear combination of ICNs delineated using Independent Components Analysis at rest. We found that across subjects, the cingulo-opercular Set Maintenance ICN, as well as right and left Frontoparietal Control ICNs, were reliably activated during working memory, while Default Mode and Visual ICNs were reliably deactivated. Further, involvement of Set Maintenance, Frontoparietal Control, and Dorsal Attention ICNs was sensitive to varying working memory load. Finally, the degree of left Frontoparietal Control network activation predicted response speed, while activation in both left Frontoparietal Control and Dorsal Attention networks predicted task accuracy. These results suggest that a close relationship between resting-state networks and taskevoked activation is functionally relevant for behavior, and that spatial multiple regression analysis is a suitable method for revealing that relationship.

Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is associated with attention/arousal dysregulation and possible inefficiencies in some cognitive functions. However, the neurobiological bases of these teratogenic effects have not been well characterized. Because activities in the default mode network (DMN) reflect intrinsic brain functions that are closely associated with arousal regulation and cognition, alterations in the DMN could underlie cognitive effects related to PCE. With resting-state and task activation functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this study investigated the possible PCE related changes in functional brain connectivity and brain activation in the DMN. In the resting state, the PCE group was found to have stronger functional connectivity in the DMN, as compared to the nonexposed controls. During a working memory task with emotional distracters, the PCE group exhibited less deactivation in the DMN and their fMRI signal was more increased by emotional arousal. These data revealed additional neural effects related to PCE, and consistent with previous findings, indicate that PCE may affect behavior and functioning by increasing baseline arousal and altering the excitatory/inhibitory balancing mechanisms involved in cognitive resource allocation.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder with complex genetic aetiology. The identification of candidate intermediate phenotypes may facilitate the detection of susceptibility genes and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the disorder. Electroencephalography (EEG) is an ideal neuroscientific approach, providing a direct measurement of neural activity that demonstrates reliability, developmental stability and high heritability. This systematic review evaluates the utility of a subset of electrophysiological measures as potential intermediate phenotypes for ADHD: quantitative EEG indices of arousal and intraindividual variability, and functional investigations of attention, inhibition and performance monitoring using the event-related potential (ERP) technique. Each measure demonstrates consistent and meaningful associations with ADHD, a degree of genetic overlap with ADHD and potential links to specific genetic variants. Investigations of the genetic and environmental contributions to EEG/ERP and shared genetic overlap with ADHD might enhance molecular genetic studies and provide novel insights into aetiology. Such research will aid in the precise characterisation of the clinical deficits seen in ADHD and guide the development of novel intervention and prevention strategies for those at risk. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a developmental condition characterised by impairing levels of inattentive, impulsive and hyperactive symptoms (Ref. 1), with a prevalence of around 5% in school-aged children (Ref. 2). The disorder frequently persists into adult life, with approximately 15% of children with ADHD retaining the diagnosis by the age

In recent years, a change in perspective in etiological models of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has occurred in concordance with emerging concepts in other neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. These models shift the focus of the assumed pathology from regional brain abnormalities to dysfunction in distributed network organization. In the current contribution, we report findings from functional connectivity studies during resting and task states, as well as from studies on structural connectivity using diffusion tensor imaging, in subjects with ADHD. Although major methodological limitations in analyzing connectivity measures derived from noninvasive in vivo neuroimaging still exist, there is convergent evidence for white matter pathology and disrupted anatomical connectivity in ADHD. In addition, dysfunctional connectivity during rest and during cognitive tasks has been demonstrated. However, the causality between disturbed white matter architecture and cortical dysfunction remains to be evaluated. Both genetic and environmental factors might contribute to disruptions in interactions between different brain regions. Stimulant medication not only modulates regionally specific activation strength but also normalizes dysfunctional connectivity, pointing to a predominant network dysfunction in ADHD. By combining a longitudinal approach with a systems perspective in ADHD in the future, it might be possible to identify at which stage during development disruptions in neural networks emerge and to delineate possible new endophenotypes of ADHD.

When people wakefully rest in the functional MRI scanner, their minds wander, and they engage a so-called default mode (DM) of neural processing that is relatively suppressed when attention is focused on the outside world. Accruing evidence suggests that DM brain systems activated during rest are also important for active, internally focused psychosocial mental processing, for example, when recalling personal memories, imagining the future, and feeling social emotions with moral connotations. Here the authors review evidence for the DM and relations to psychological functioning, including associations with mental health and cognitive abilities like reading comprehension and divergent thinking. This article calls for research into the dimensions of internally focused thought, ranging from free-form daydreaming and off-line consolidation to intensive, effortful abstract thinking, especially with socioemotional relevance. It is argued that the development of some socioemotional skills may be vulnerable to disruption by environmental distraction, for example, from certain educational practices or overuse of social media. The authors hypothesize that high environmental attention demands may bias youngsters to focus on the concrete, physical, and immediate aspects of social situations and self, which may be more compatible with external attention. They coin the term constructive internal reflection and advocate educational practices that promote effective balance between external attention and internal reflection.

The relationship of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to learning disorders was reviewed and included reading disability, mathematics learning disability, and nonverbal learning disability. Genetic, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological functioning were examined for each disorder, along with a discussion of any existing literature when ADHD co-occurred with the disorder. All the disorders were found to frequently co-occur with ADHD. A review of the underlying neuroanatomic and neurofunctional data found specific structures that frequently co-occur in these disorders with others that are specific to the individual diagnosis. Aberrations in structure and/or function were found for the caudate, corpus callosum, and cerebellum, making these structures sensitive for the disorder but not specific. Suggestions for future research, particularly in relation to intervention, are provided.

Many neuroimaging investigations focus on hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, few investigate default-mode network (DMN) in the patients with HE and its underlying physiological relevance using resting-state fMRI. In this study, independent component analysis was used to retrieve components representing the DMN of patients with HE (n ¼ 14) and healthy volunteers (n ¼ 14). Four patients were excluded because of head motion (n ¼ 3) and the artifact from the artificial tooth (n ¼ 1). Comparison results between the two groups revealed significantly reduced functional connectivity in the right middle frontal gyrus and left posterior cingulate cortex in the HE patients. A statistical tmap from the comparison of venous blood ammonia levels and the z-scores of the DMN obtained from independent component analysis was computed in the HE group, which showed negative correlation with the changes in left angular gyrus. In conclusions, resting-state fMRI can be used to examine DMN changes in HE patients. Reduced functional connectivity in the right middle frontal gyrus and left posterior cingulate cortex consisting of the DMN and negative correlation between the functional connectivity changes in left AG and the venous blood ammonia levels support the notion of damages in functional organization of the central nervous system in HE patients.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is among the most common psychiatric disorders of childhood, and there is great interest in understanding its neurobiological basis. A prominent neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that ADHD involves a lag in brain maturation. Previous work has found support for this hypothesis, but examinations have been limited to structural features of the brain (e.g., gray matter volume or cortical thickness). More recently, a growing body of work demonstrates that the brain is functionally organized into a number of large-scale networks, and the connections within and between these networks exhibit characteristic patterns of maturation. In this study, we investigated whether individuals with ADHD (age 7.2-21.8 y) exhibit a lag in maturation of the brain&#39;s developing functional architecture. Using connectomic methods applied to a large, multisite dataset of resting state scans, we quantified the effect of maturation and the effect of ADHD at more than 400,000 connections throughout the cortex. We found significant and specific maturational lag in connections within default mode network (DMN) and in DMN interconnections with two task positive networks (TPNs): frontoparietal network and ventral attention network. In particular, lag was observed within the midline core of the DMN, as well as in DMN connections with right lateralized prefrontal regions (in frontoparietal network) and anterior insula (in ventral attention network). Current models of the pathophysiology of attention dysfunction in ADHD emphasize altered DMN-TPN interactions. Our finding of maturational lag specifically in connections within and between these networks suggests a developmental etiology for the deficits proposed in these models.

Over the past 5 years, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has begun to provide new evidence about the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on white matter development. DTI, which examines microstructural tissue integrity, is sensitive to more subtle white matter abnormalities than traditional volumetric MRI methods. Thus far, the available DTI data suggest that white matter microstructural abnormalities fall on a continuum of severity in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Abnormalities are prominent in the corpus callosum, but also evident in major anterior-posterior fiber bundles, corticospinal tracts, and cerebellum. These subtle abnormalities are correlated with neurocognitive deficits, especially in processing speed, non-verbal ability, and executive functioning. Future studies using larger samples, increasingly sophisticated DTI methods, and additional functional MRI connectivity measures will better characterize the full range of abnormalities in FASD. Ultimately, these measures may serve as indices of change in future longitudinal studies and in studies of interventions for FASD.

Resting state functional connectivity analysis is a widely used method for mapping intrinsic functional organization of the brain. Global signal regression (GSR) is commonly employed for removing systemic global variance from resting state BOLD-fMRI data; however, recent studies have demonstrated that GSR may introduce spurious negative correlations within and between functional networks, calling into question the meaning of anticorrelations reported between some networks. In the present study, we propose that global signal from resting state fMRI is composed primarily of systemic low frequency oscillations (sLFOs) that propagate with cerebral blood circulation throughout the brain. We introduce a novel systemic noise removal strategy for resting state fMRI data, &#34;dynamic global signal regression&#34; (dGSR), which applies a voxel-specific optimal time delay to the global signal prior to regression from voxel-wise time series. We test our hypothesis on two functional systems that are suggested to be intrinsically organized into anticorrelated networks: the default mode network (DMN) and task positive network (TPN). We evaluate the efficacy of dGSR and compare its performance with the conventional &#34;static&#34; global regression (sGSR) method in terms of (i) explaining systemic variance in the data and (ii) enhancing specificity and sensitivity of functional connectivity measures. dGSR increases the amount of BOLD signal variance being modeled and removed relative to sGSR while reducing spurious negative correlations introduced in reference regions by sGSR, and attenuating inflated positive connectivity measures. We conclude that incorporating time delay information for sLFOs into global noise removal strategies is of crucial importance for optimal noise removal from resting state functional connectivity maps.

The use of stimulant drugs for the treatment of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most widespread pharmacological interventions in child psychiatry and behavioral pediatrics. This treatment is well grounded on controlled studies showing efficacy of low oral doses of methylphenidate and amphetamine in reducing the behavioral symptoms of the disorder as reported by parents and teachers, both for the cognitive (inattention and impulsivity) and noncognitive (hyperactivity) domains. Our main aim is to review the objectively measured cognitive effects that accompany the subjectively assessed clinical responses to stimulant medications. Recently, methods from the cognitive neurosciences have been used to provide information about brain processes that underlie the cognitive deficits of ADHD and the cognitive effects of stimulant medications. We will review some key findings from the recent literature, and then offer interpretations of the progress that has been made over the past decade in understanding the cognitive effects of stimulant medication on individuals with ADHD.

The default-mode network (DMN) in humans consists of a set of brain regions that, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), show both intrinsic correlations with each other and suppression during externally oriented tasks. Resting-state fMRI studies have previously identified similar patterns of intrinsic correlations in overlapping brain regions in rodents (A29C/posterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, and medial temporal lobe structures). However, due to challenges with performing rodent behavior in an MRI machine, it is still unclear whether activity in rodent DMN regions are suppressed during externally oriented visual tasks. Using distributed local field potential measurements in rats, we have discovered that activity in DMN brain regions noted above show task-related suppression during an externally oriented visual task at alpha and low beta-frequencies. Interestingly, this suppression (particularly in posterior cingulate cortex) was linked with impr...

Altered power of resting-state neurophysiological activity has been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which commonly co-occur. We compared resting-state neurophysiological power in children with ASD, ADHD, co-occurring ASD + ADHD, and typically developing controls. Children with ASD (ASD/ASD + ADHD) showed reduced theta and alpha power compared to children without ASD (controls/ADHD). Children with ADHD (ADHD/ASD + ADHD) displayed decreased delta power compared to children without ADHD (ASD/controls). Children with ASD + ADHD largely presented as an additive cooccurrence with deficits of both disorders, although reduced theta compared to ADHD-only and reduced delta compared to controls suggested some unique markers. Identifying specific neurophysiological profiles in ASD and ADHD may assist in characterising more homogeneous subgroups to inform treatment approaches and aetiological investigations.

Prader--Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex neurogenetic disorder with symptoms that indicate not only hypothalamic, but also a global, central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. However, little is known about developmental differences in brain structure in children with PWS. Thus, our aim was to investigate global brain morphology in children with PWS, including the comparison between different genetic subtypes of PWS. In addition, we performed exploratory cortical and subcortical focal analyses. High resolution structural magnetic resonance images were acquired in 20 children with genetically confirmed PWS (11 children carrying a deletion (DEL), 9 children with maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD)), and compared with 11 age- and gender-matched typically developing siblings as controls. Brain morphology measures were obtained using the FreeSurfer software suite. Both children with DEL and mUPD showed smaller brainstem volume, and a trend towards smaller cortical surface area and white m...

Background: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in Central Auditory Processing Disorder (C)APD. However, the neural correlates of (C)APD are poorly understood. Previous neuroimaging experiments have shown changes in the intrinsic activity of the brain in various cognitive deficits and brain disorders. The present study investigated the spontaneous brain activity in (C)APD subjects with resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Methods: Thirteen children diagnosed with (C)APD and fifteen age and gender-matched controls participated in a rs-fMRI study during which they were asked to relax keeping their eyes open. Two different techniques of the rs-fMRI data analysis were used: Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which approach is rare. Results: Both methods of data analysis showed comparable results in the pattern of DMN activity within groups. Additionally, ReHo analysis revealed increased co-activation of the superior frontal gyrus, the posterior cingulate cortex/the precuneus in controls, compared to the (C)APD group. ICA yielded inconsistent results across groups. Conclusions: Our ReHo results suggest that (C)APD children seem to present reduced regional homogeneity in brain regions considered a part of the default mode network (DMN). These findings might contribute to a better understanding of neural mechanisms of (C)APD.

Previous investigations of the default-mode network (DMN) in persons with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have shown reduced functional connectivity between the anterior and posterior aspects. This finding was originally demonstrated in adults with ADHD, then in youth with ADHD, and has been tentatively linked to ultra low frequency oscillations within the DMN. The current study evaluates the specificity of DMN abnormalities to neuronal oscillations in the ultra low frequency range, and examines the regional specificity of these DMN aberrations in medicated and unmedicated adults with, and those without ADHD. An individually matched sample of adults with and without ADHD completed 6-minute sessions of resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants with ADHD were known responders to stimulant medications and completed two sessions (predrug/postdrug). MEG data were coregistered to the participant&#39;s MRI, corrected for head motion, fitted to a regional-level source model, and subjected to spectral analyses to extract neuronal population activity in regions of the DMN. The unmedicated adults with ADHD exhibited broadband deficits in medial prefrontal cortices (MPFC), but not other DMN regions compared to adults without ADHD. Unmedicated patients also showed abnormal cross-frequency coupling in the gamma range between the MPFC and posterior cingulate areas, and disturbed balance within the DMN as activity in posterior regions was stronger than frontal regions at beta and lower frequencies, which dissipated at higher c-frequencies. Administration of pharmacotherapy significantly increased prefrontal alpha activity (8-14 Hz) in adults with ADHD, and decreased the cross-frequency gamma coupling. These results indicate that neurophysiological aberrations in the DMN of patients with ADHD are not limited to ultra slow oscillations, and that they may be primarily attributable to abnormal broadband activity in the MPFC.

Previous studies have associated Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with a maturational lag of brain functional networks. Functional connectivity of the human brain changes from primarily local to more distant connectivity patterns during typical development. Under the maturational lag hypothesis, we expect children with ADHD to exhibit increased local connectivity and decreased distant connectivity compared with neurotypically developing (ND) children. We applied a graph-theory method to compute local and distant connectivity levels and cross-sectionally compared them in a sample of 120 children with ADHD and 120 age-matched ND children (age range = 7-17 years). In addition, we measured if potential group differences in local and distant connectivity were stable across the age range considered. Finally, we assessed the clinical relevance of observed group differences by correlating the connectivity levels and ADHD symptoms severity separately for each group. Children w...

Using secondary database analysis, we tested whether the (implicit) familiarity of eliciting noun-cues and the (explicit) vividness of corresponding imagery exerted additive or interactive influences on verbal learning, as measured by the probability of incidental noun recall and image latency times (RTs). Noun-cues with incongruent levels of vividness and familiarity (high/low; low/high, respectively) at encoding were subsequently associated at retrieval with the lowest recall probabilities, while noun-cues related with congruent levels (high/high; low/low) were associated with higher recall probabilities. RTs in the high vividness and high familiarity grouping were significantly faster than all other subsets (low/low, low/high, high/low) which did not significantly differ among each other.
