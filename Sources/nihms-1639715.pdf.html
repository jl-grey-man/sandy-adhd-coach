Abstract
Dopamine neurons have been intensely studied for their roles in reinforcement learning. A
dominant theory of how these neurons contribute to learning is through the encoding of a reward
prediction error (RPE) signal. Recent advances in dopamine research have added nuance to RPE
theory by incorporating the ideas of sensory prediction error, distributional encoding, and belief
states. Further nuance is likely to be added shortly by convergent lines of research on dopamine
neuron diversity. Finally, a major challenge is to reconcile RPE theory with other current theories
of dopamine function to account for dopamine’s role in movement, motivation, and goal-directed
planning.
Introduction
Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have been intensely studied for their
role in reinforcement learning. These dopamine neurons encode reward prediction error
(RPE) – the difference between predicted and received rewards. RPE encoding in dopamine
neurons was first suggested by Schultz et al. in 1997 [1]. The hypothesis that dopamine
neurons function to encode RPE gripped the attention of many neuroscientists due to its
excellent coherence with the predictions of temporal difference reinforcement models of
learning [2,3]. Now, more than 20 years after the initial suggestion, there is little doubt that
RPE is an essential part of what dopamine does in the brain. But is it everything? Recent
progress in dopamine research has led to stronger formulations of the RPE hypothesis,
which have refined the theory while largely confirming the initial observation. However, it
remains a challenge to incorporate other hypothesized functions of dopamine, for example in
motivation and motor behavior, into the RPE hypothesis. Whether dopamine’s functions can

indeed be united under one theory is not clear: many recent studies have also brought
attention to previously underappreciated dopamine neuron diversity. This diversity – in gene
expression, intrinsic currents, synaptic connectivity, and neurotransmitter co-release – could
give rise to a diversity of functions not amenable to description under one theory. In this
review, we provide a brief synopsis of exciting advancements in understanding how
dopamine neurons encode RPE, as well as an overview of emerging evidence for
dopamine’s other functions in reward-related, motor, and cognitive behaviors and their
relationship to the theme of cell type diversity.
Advancements in Understanding Dopamine’s Encoding of Reward
Prediction Error
The advent of optogenetics in the early 2000s brought a revolution to our investigations of
dopamine function. In particular, an important early study by Steinberg et al. [4] formally
demonstrated causality in RPE by testing a strong, formal version of the RPE hypothesis
using a behavioral procedure known as “blocking.” In the blocking procedure, an animal
first learns that a single cue (A) fully predicts a reward (R). Once the association is learned,
it “blocks” new learning about redundant cues. For example, if animals are trained that A
$→R and then that AX →R, they will not learn that X→R. Since A is fully predictive of R,$
the additional presentation of X does not add any predictive value. Therefore, there is no
RPE generated by dopamine neurons at the reward delivery time and no new learning about
X occurs. Steinberg et al. found that optogenetically imposing an RPE by stimulating VTA
$dopamine neurons at the time of reward during compound (AX→R) training could unblock$
learning. This experiment showed that VTA dopamine neurons were not only computing a
signed, quantitative RPE, but that this RPE signal was sufficient to update the animal’s value
learning system and change behavior.
Recently, Maes et al. [5] have built on these findings using a similar blocking paradigm in
conjunction with optogenetic inhibition of VTA dopamine neurons, in this case during the
time of cue presentation. By manipulating cue-evoked dopamine signals, they tested whether
$cue-evoked dopamine transmission is an RPE signal. They trained animals that A→R, and$
$then that both AX →R and AY→ R. Normally, learning about X and Y would be blocked.$
The experiment was then to optogenetically inhibit dopamine neurons during presentations
of AX (but not AY) and ask whether this inhibition unblocks learning about X compared to
Y. This clever design can distinguish between two possibilities for what cue-evoked
dopamine might be encoding: if cue-evoked dopamine encodes a value prediction,
suppressing it should unblock learning about X (X did not predict reward; therefore, reward
was unexpected; therefore, one should learn about X). On the other hand, if cue-evoked
dopamine encodes reward prediction error, then the lack of an error should not generate any
new learning. The authors found that learning about X and Y was equally blocked. This
result provides evidence that dopamine encodes a strictly-defined RPE that is not to be
conflated with the prediction itself.
Other recent optogenetic stimulation experiments also support the same conclusion:
optogenetic stimulation of VTA dopamine neurons can promote associations between cues

and rewards or between cues and other valueless cues, without causing any cues to acquire
value [6,7]. There is evidence that predicted value is encoded by inputs to dopamine neurons
– e.g., the prefrontal cortex – but NOT by dopamine neurons themselves [8,9]. Together,
these experiments help to rule out the direct encoding of value or value prediction by
dopamine neurons, solidifying RPE theory.
Additionally, Morrens et al. [10] showed that novel, but not familiar, cues evoke dopamine
release and that if dopamine release is inhibited during a novel cue, learning about that cue
is impaired. These findings help explain why animals learn more quickly about novel cues.
They also fit well with another important, recently developed idea that dopamine acts not
only as a prediction error for reward values but also as a prediction error for sensory
experiences (“sensory prediction errors”; [11–14]). The idea that cue-evoked dopamine
occurs before associations are learned, and helps guide that learning, also fits with ideas
about how novelty responses can help mark events with an unknown potential for reward
association [15].
How do dopamine neurons encode prediction errors? An exciting new idea, that of a
distributional RPE code, is inspired by artificial intelligence research. The idea is that
instead of all dopamine neurons encoding a similar mean prediction error, each neuron
might encode either a more “optimistic” or more “pessimistic” prediction, distributed around
the mean. Using many cells to represent a range of predictions allows the brain to capture a
full probability distribution for future rewards and in theory improves reinforcement
learning. Indeed, Dabney et al. [16] found strong evidence for distributional RPE encoding
in single-unit recordings from VTA dopamine neurons in mice performing probabilistic
learning tasks. These findings fit with previous recordings by the same group, which showed
that individual VTA dopamine neurons compute complete RPEs (via subtraction), albeit
with heterogeneity in scaling [17–19]. Distributional RPE encoding is likely achieved
through variations in intrinsic excitability as well as in the complement of inputs each
individual dopamine neuron receives from a variety of brain areas [20].
A final, important recent addition to our understanding of how dopamine neurons encode
RPE is the proposal that RPEs depend on hidden belief states. A “state” is a neural
representation of environmental conditions at a given time. However, deterministic external
signals about the animal’s current state are not always available. Therefore, belief states are
created in cases where an animal must rely on some probabilistic assessment of what state it
is likely to be in. To test whether belief states contribute to RPE encoding by dopamine
neurons, several different tests have been designed in which the external cues indicating
state are ambiguous. One test used perceptual ambiguity in the cues predicting reward [21],
another created ambiguity by using the same cue to predict both large and small rewards in
randomly alternating (unsignaled) blocks [22], another used variable cue-reward intervals
combined with probabilistically-delivered rewards to cause ambiguity about whether
particular trials were long-interval trials vs. omission trials [23]. In all of these
manipulations, the responses of VTA dopamine neurons were well accounted for by RPE
models incorporating belief states. Therefore, RPE signals are not necessarily accurate
representations of error, but reflect an animal’s internal understanding of its environment
based on previous experiences in that environment.

Going Beyond Reward Prediction Error
In the studies discussed thus far, researchers focused on VTA dopamine neurons. Even more
specifically, these studies focused primarily on dopamine neurons in the lateral VTA, which
have a specific set of cellular, molecular, and synaptic properties compared to dopamine
neurons as a whole, and which primarily project to the nucleus accumbens lateral shell
[24,25]. Not all dopamine neurons are alike. For example, using the blocking paradigm
described above, Keiflin et al. [14] showed that while optogenetic stimulation of VTA
dopamine neurons at the time of reward can unblock learning, optogenetic stimulation of
nearby substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons cannot. These results, and
others, suggest that SNc dopamine neurons do not encode RPE, despite being capable of
acting as a primary reinforcer [14,26–28]. Another set of dopamine neurons in the far lateral
portion of the substantia nigra (SNL), which project to the caudal tail of the striatum, receive
a distinct array of inputs compared to VTA and SNc, and respond to salient, novel stimuli
[29–32]. Other recent studies additionally emphasize heterogeneity in the encoding
properties of VTA dopamine neurons [33,34], adding to a story of heterogeneity from earlier
studies of projection-defined VTA dopamine neurons [25,35]. Thus, there is a growing need
in the field to add specificity in our methods of identifying dopamine neurons and to
carefully report which subsets of dopamine neurons are under scrutiny in any given
experiment.
Diverse Molecular Phenotypes of Midbrain Dopamine Neurons
Studies identifying heterogeneity in dopamine neurons based on their locations and
projection targets have emphasized the need to answer the question: just how heterogenous
is the midbrain dopamine system? How do we define dopamine cell types? Molecular
approaches are offering some insight. Using single-cell gene expression analyses,
researchers have proposed the existence of ~4–7 distinct groups of midbrain dopamine
neurons defined by the expression of genes such as Aldh1a1, Sox6, and Vglut2 [36–41].
These exciting studies offer promise in explaining the heterogeneity of dopamine neuron
responses in vivo. Still, work remains to be done to map molecularly-defined groups of
neurons onto anatomically-defined groups. Poulin et al. [42] took a step in this direction
when they used intersectional genetic strategies to create mouse lines for selecting out
molecularly-defined dopamine neuron subtypes for study. They mapped the projection
patterns of various subtypes and noted different (but overlapping) patterns of forebrain
innervation. In terms of input connectivity, previous studies have indicated that projection-
defined dopamine neurons receive distinct patterns of input [29,43–45], but it is as yet
unclear how this aspect of connectivity interfaces with the molecular phenotypes of
dopamine neurons.
How do molecularly-defined populations of dopamine neurons contribute to behavior? One
recent study addressed this question for aldehyde dehydrogenase-positive (Aldh1a1+)
dopamine neurons in the SNc and found that this population is crucial for the acquisition of
motor skills in the rotarod task [46]. However, the question of what Aldh1a1+ dopamine
neurons are encoding during motor skill acquisition remains. Another recent study defined
VTA dopamine neuron subtypes by their expression of the neuropeptidergic markers Crhr1

(corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1) and Cck (cholecystokinin) [47]. They found
that Crhr1- and Cck-expressing VTA dopamine neurons project to the core and medial shell
of the nucleus accumbens, respectively. These two groups of dopamine neurons were critical
for distinct parts of behavioral reinforcement: Crhr1-expressing VTA dopamine neurons
were critical for establishing instrumental action-outcome and Pavlovian cue-reward
associations, while Cck-expressing VTA dopamine neurons helped motivate responding for
a reward after an action-outcome relationship was established. These findings suggest that
while most dopamine neurons increase their activity in response to rewards, different
subtypes are critical for individual features of reward processing. Future studies examining
the interface between neuropeptidergic phenotype and the gene expression patterns defined
by single-cell sequencing studies, however, are still necessary to fully define dopaminergic
heterogeneity at the molecular level and to align these definitions with behavioral
observations.
Dopamine Neurons Use More than Dopamine to Communicate
One important consequence of variations in gene expression in midbrain dopamine neurons
is variations in neurotransmitter co-release. It has become increasingly evident that
dopamine neurons can release more than their namesake: subsets of dopamine neurons co-
release classical fast neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA [48–54]. The relevance
of co-release for behavior is an area of active investigation and debate. For example,
concerning glutamate co-transmission, Wang et al. demonstrated that co-release of glutamate
from dopamine terminals in the ventral striatum does not contribute to acquisition of
intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) or real-time place preference (RTPP) for optogenetic
stimulation [55]. Meanwhile, Zell et al. found that conditionally ablating tyrosine
hydroxylase from neurons that co-release glutamate and dopamine also did not affect ICSS
acquisition and RTPP, despite a loss of dopamine release in the ventral striatum [56].
Together, these studies suggest redundant roles of glutamate and dopamine release in
“dopamine” neurons, at least in the specific behavioral paradigms examined. Future studies
are necessary to ascertain the exact timing, signaling dynamics, and downstream effects of
co-transmitter release by dopamine neurons, and elucidate their functions across all of
striatum. Notably, the possibility of co-release means that studies of dopamine cell body
firing in the midbrain cannot necessarily claim that the downstream circuit effects of this
firing are due to dopamine release alone. To determine the contributions of dopamine release
per se to downstream circuit function in future experiments, new tools such as fluorescent
dopamine sensors [57–60] and sensors allowing researchers to track the biochemical
responses of dopamine receptor-expressing neurons during behavior [61] will be
instrumental.
Dopamine and Movement
Parkinson’s disease – in which SNc dopamine neurons slowly degenerate – has long made
evident the importance of dopamine in spontaneous movement. Yet, it remains unclear how dopamine neurons participate in motor control. Recent studies have deepened our
understanding, demonstrating that dopamine neurons – primarily in the SNc but also in the
VTA – show phasic activity related to different components of movement such as action

choice, initiation, vigor, and velocity [62–70]. These signals have not been explained by
RPE theory and, using excitatory optogenetics, have been shown to be sufficient to trigger
movement. Still, the physiological role of movement-related dopamine neurons is under
debate. Coddington and Dudman have suggested that the portion of dopamine neurons that
are naturally active during movement initiation is small and that optogenetic stimulation of
dopamine neurons must be extremely supraphysiological to evoke movement directly [71].
Notably, when Wu et al. ablated Aldh1a1+ SNc dopamine neurons (a sizeable portion of the
SNc dopamine population, and the dopamine neurons most vulnerable in Parkinson’s
Disease), they did not observe immediate parkinsonism, but merely a slight decrease in high-
speed movements combined with a profound motor learning deficit [46]. This result suggests
that SNc dopamine neurons are not primarily responsible for movement initiation and that
parkinsonism arises mostly from slower basal ganglia-wide adaptations to progressive
dopamine loss.
Movement-related dopamine neurons are largely located in SNc, where they encode
contralateral actions [62,63,72]. Yet, there is also evidence for the representation of
movement in VTA dopamine neurons. Using a ‘Go-NoGo’ task, Syed et al. [68]
demonstrated that if an animal did not need to initiate movement to obtain a reward,
dopamine release in the NAc core in response to a cue predicting the reward was attenuated.
Engelhard et al. [33] have also argued for the representation of kinematic variables by at
least a subset of VTA dopamine neurons, alongside RPE representation. Furthermore,
Hughes et al. used sensitive measurements of force generated by mice in a head-fixed fixed-
time interval task to observe three populations of VTA dopamine neurons representing
different aspects of forward and backward movement relative to a reward lick spout [70].
Although the firing rates of dopamine neurons they recorded were tightly linked to
movement, these movement relationships were only observed in highly trained, not naïve,
mice. Based on these results, it seems likely that dopamine neurons track both movement
and RPE, often simultaneously in the same cells. There may be good reason for dopamine
neurons to track both signals together: to assign credit to our actions accurately, we need to
detect when rewards are missed not because of misunderstandings in cue-outcome or action-
outcome relationships, but because of errors in motor execution [73; see also 74]. This is an
enticing idea, but more work is still required to understand how movement signals interact
with RPE to drive motivated behavior and motor learning.
Dopamine, Motivation, and Planning: What Are Dopamine Ramps For?
Dopamine “ramps,” in which dopamine activity and release increases as an animal gets
closer to reward, have been proposed as a mechanism of maintaining motivation to work for
distal rewards and properly linking credit back to the initial cue or action that resulted in a
positive outcome [69,75,76]. Notably, ramping occurs more readily when mice are
participating in instrumental rather than Pavlovian tasks [77–79]. The phenomenon has been
observed robustly in the VTA and ventral striatum [69,75,76,78–82], as well as in the
dorsomedial striatum [77,83]. There is less evidence for strong ramping in the dorsolateral
striatum [75,77,83].

The origin of ramping activity remains controversial. Ramping is reliably observed when
measuring the postsynaptic release of dopamine (using microdialysis, voltammetry, and
dopamine sensor imaging) [69,75–78,81]. It has also been observed when measuring the
activity of dopamine axons in the striatum using calcium sensors [77,78,83]. However,
controversy exists as to the observation of ramps in cell body activity. Mohebi et al. [81]
report an absence of ramping in VTA cell bodies (measured using electrophysiology) even
when ramps are observed in the NAc (measured using voltammetry and dopamine sensor
imaging), suggesting ramps could be locally generated in axons. However, others have
observed ramps when measuring cell body activity, which are more obvious when
population measures such as fiber photometry are used instead of electrophysiological
recordings of single units [33,78–80,82]. Thus, there is an argument about whether ramps
are generated in cell bodies, and, if they are, whether axonal mechanisms could still
accentuate them.
What is the computational role of ramps? Again, controversy exists, and the answer may
vary depending on the subpopulations of dopamine neurons being examined. To date,
investigations of dopamine heterogeneity have largely not been brought to bear on the
question of dopamine ramping. One school of thought is that dopamine ramps can be
successfully incorporated into RPE theory [2,69,77,84,85]. Ramping could be explained by
the back propagation of RPEs during learning and thus used to reinforce action choices
[2,69,85]. Mikhael et al. [84] argue that sensory feedback plays an important role in
generating ramps from RPE by reducing the uncertainty about time to reward.
Another school of thought is that dopamine ramps are better explained as motivational
signals, or as a means of coordinated goal-directed action planning [75,76,79,81]. Song and
Lee [82] suggest a model in which a ramping-to-phasic transition in dopamine signaling is
related to a reduction in task dimensionality as subjects narrow their focus to relevant
stimuli. They suggest that ramps should fade as instrumental learning asymptotes and habits
begin to form [76,82]. In contrast, Guru et al [79] observe that ramps generally fade with
repetitive training, and provide evidence that ramps are only maintained under conditions
where internal goal representations are necessary to support behavior. These explanations of
the roles of dopamine ramping in behavior, as well as a fuller characterization of when
dopamine ramps occur and how they are generated, await further investigation. At present,
the wide range of tasks and recording methods used to detect ramps, as well as the lack of an
agreed-upon definition for ramping, are hindering progress in this burgeoning area of
interest.
Conclusion
Much exciting progress has been made in dopamine research in recent years, but challenges
lie ahead. The field must begin to map studies of computational function onto molecularly-
defined groups of dopamine neurons. Such studies would help to clarify whether or not
molecularly-defined groups of dopamine neurons all serve to encode RPE, and whether each
group of neurons serves single or multiple computational functions. A comprehensive
mapping of computational function onto molecularly-defined dopamine cell types will add

richness to both RPE theory and other theories on dopamine’s role in supporting reward- and
motor-related behaviors.
Going further, we must also better understand how dopamine signals in distinct subsets of
neurons are being generated by upstream circuits and interpreted by downstream circuits. On
the former problem, input mapping studies have led the way [20,29,43,44,86] but a good
deal of work is left to describe the detailed mechanisms by which these inputs contribute to
the encoding properties of dopamine neurons, as well as to understand how such
connectivity might be altered by sex, across development and aging, and in conditions (e.g.,
stress) that are related to the emergence of psychiatric conditions. On the latter problem, we
are only beginning to understand the transformations that take place between dopamine cell
body activity, axon activity, and neurotransmitter release [81]. The astoundingly complex
axonal arbors of midbrain dopamine neurons [87] provoke many questions about how action
potential propagation is regulated. Complex neuromodulatory mechanisms are known to
regulate dopamine release at terminals [88,89]. Different release machinery can regulate
dopamine release on different time scales [90,91], and yet further mechanisms may regulate
the differential co-release of other neurotransmitters [50,52]. Thus, even when we observe
RPE signals while recording dopamine neuron action potentials at cell bodies, we may
question whether and in what form downstream circuits are receiving these signals. As
researchers tackle these difficult questions in the coming years, theories of dopamine
function will, no doubt, again need to be updated.

[PubMed: 30581025] This study demonstrated an important distinction between VTA and SNc dopamine neurons’ functions. While previous studies had suggested that both VTA and SNc stimulation could support primary reinforcement in self-stimulation paradigms, and Schultz’s original work on RPE included observations from both VTA and SNc dopamine neurons, this study showed that VTA dopamine stimulation can unblock learning, while SNc dopamine stimulation cannot. The result suggests that SNc dopamine neurons do not encode strictly-defined RPE, despite having reward-related responses. This study also serves as an important to reminder that most of studies of dopamine and RPE are really examining a specific subset of anatomically-defined dopamine neurons in the VTA, and that we have not yet fully squared findings of dopamine neuron heterogeneity with RPE theory.</li>

[PubMed: 31942076] This innovative study shows that RPEs are represented in the VTA as a distributional code, meaning that although individual VTA dopamine neurons fully encode RPE, they each do so slightly differently, making an array of more optimistic and pessimistic predictions. The distributional encoding of RPE helps explains the apparent redundancy of RPE encoding in the system.

Considering the variety of peptidergic inputs to midbrain dopamine neurons, this study inspires others to elucidate how the identities of peptide-defined dopamine neurons intersect with molecular phenotypes, as defined by gene expression analyses, and further probe the behavioral contributions of peptide-defined dopamine neurons to reward-related behaviors.</li>

Current Biology 2020, 30:2681–2694.e5. [PubMed: 32470362] This provocative study challenges the dogma that VTA dopamine neurons encode RPE, arguing instead for movement encoding. The authors use in vivo electrophysiology to record the firing patterns of optogenetically-tagged VTA dopamine neurons in mice. Sensitive measurements of force generation in a head-fixation apparatus reveal subtle head movements as mice collect rewards during a fixed-time interval task. No explicit cues preceded reward delivery in the task, but mice learned to perform anticipatory licking – along with stereotyped movement sequences associated with this licking – based on timing. Three different populations of dopamine neurons were identified based on their correlations with force exerted over time, i.e. the “impulse vector.” (Notably, only one population displayed ramping). Further optogenetic experiments showed that, in highly trained mice, VTA dopamine neuron stimulation could cause forward force generation. Additional work is clearly required to determine whether the hypothesis of impulse vector encoding will hold and/or be integrated with RPE theory. It remains a critical question in the field to better understand when dopamine controls movement and how motor execution and error signals drive reward learning.
*71. Coddington LT, Dudman JT: The timing of action determines reward prediction signals in identified midbrain dopamine neurons. Nat Neurosci 2018, 21:1563–1573. [PubMed: 30323275] This study used in vivo electrophysiology to record the activity of optogenetically-tagged VTA and SNc dopamine neurons during learning of an auditory trace conditioning task. It is unique and innovative in part because the authors record from mice as they first begin to learn, instead of only examining dopamine activity in well-trained mice. Thus, the paper offers insight into how RPE encoding is slowly created over many trials. The authors find that dopamine responses to rewards and predictive cues emerge independently (not as a gradual transfer from reward to cue), and that reward expectation signals reflect a summation of emergent sensory cue signals and action initiation signals, that latter of which is responsible for the timing of RPE signals. Furthermore, they make important observations about the relationship of dopamine to movement initiation. They find that dopamine signals related to movement initiation are altered by learning and reward context, and that optogenetic stimulation that is calibrated to match physiological dopamine signals is not sufficient produce movement initiation, despite being capable of inducing conditioned place preference.</li>

Current Biology 2019, 29:1606–1613.e5. [PubMed: 31056386] This human fMRI study proposes an interesting hypothesis regarding the interface between RPE encoding and motor control. The authors used a classical reinforcement learning task in which participants make short reaching movements to indicate choice. The participants were given feedback about whether errors leading to reward omission were associated with wrong choices vs motor execution errors. Although both wrong choices and motor execution errors lead to the same outcome (no reward), participants do not display the same lose-switch behavior. In the fMRI data, ventral striatal RPEs are attenuated following execution errors, providing a potential neurological explanation for the reduction in lose-switch behavior. These results lead to the suggestion that motor feedback influences RPE encoding to allow us to distinguish internal vs external reasons for trial-by-trial variability during reinforcement learning.

Differences between dopamine firing patterns and downstream release are suggested to be limited to minute-level timescales (“tonic” dopamine) and the reasons for the divergence are left to future studies to investigate.

The authors perform fiber photometry of VTA dopamine cell bodies as mice perform a number of tasks. They do not observe ramping in a classical Pavlovian task, but they do observe ramps when mice move towards a reward or a reward moves towards the mouse. Although this ramping is robust at first, it fades with training. In contrast, ramping towards reward does not fade when mice are asked to run a fixed distance on a running wheel in the absence of feedback cues indicating progress. The authors therefore suggest that ramps allow the generation of an internal model of progress towards reward important for goal-directed behavior.</li>

[PubMed: 31118513] The authors use microdialysis, voltammetry, and dopamine sensor imaging to monitor dopamine release on different timescales. They find that NAc core dopamine release in particular correlates with reward rate on a slow time scale, independent of changes in VTA dopamine cell firing rates. Based on their results, the authors make two provocative suggestions: (1) that tonic firing observed in VTA cell bodies is relatively constant and does not contribute to motivational changes and (2) that local modulation at dopamine terminals is responsible for producing “ramps” that encode motivation. The latter suggestion in particular is one that deserves attention and investigation in future studies – how are axonal regulatory or reuptake mechanisms in dopamine neurons transforming the encoding functions observed at cell bodies?</li>

Elife 2020, 9.This molecular study examines the mechanisms regulating dopamine release. They find that synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) is the presynaptic calcium sensor responsible for fast, synchronous dopamine release, but that another mechanism must be responsible for slower, asynchronous release. The remaining asynchronous release in the absence of Syt1 does appear to contribute substantially to the regulation of ongoing extracellular dopamine levels. The study implies that there are distinct control mechanisms regulating dopamine release on different time scales. Molecular tools may be of use, then, in dissecting the behavioral roles of such distinct forms of release.</li>
