## 📚 Old Documentation (`old_docs/`)

These files documented past issues, fixes, and states that are now integrated into the main documentation:

**For Current Information**: Read the main docs in project root:
- `README_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system overview
- `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` - Database structure
- `RECENT_UPDATES.md` - Current state

The archived docs include:
- Past bug fix documentation
- Historical audit results
- Old deployment checklists
- Superseded implementation notes
- Old analysis documents

---

## 🔧 Old Scripts (`scripts/`)

One-time utility scripts that served a specific purpose but are no longer needed:

- Database audit scripts
- Pattern checking utilities
- User creation helpers
- Database update scripts
- Timezone fix scripts

**Note**: These scripts were useful during development but most functionality is now built into the application itself.

## 🗑️ Why Archive Instead of Delete?

2. **Reference**: Might be useful for understanding past decisions
3. **Recovery**: Can reference if similar issues arise
