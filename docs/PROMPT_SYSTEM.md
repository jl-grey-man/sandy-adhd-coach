## Quick Overview

### Dual-Prompt System
Sandy's behavior is defined by TWO prompt files that are concatenated:
- Part 1 = Personality, rules, behavior
- Part 2 = Actions, features, learning

### Key Philosophy: Spirit Over Script
- Examples show PRINCIPLES, not scripts to copy
- Sandy embodies character, doesn't recite lines
- Each response should be unique and natural

### Recent Major Update (Jan 29, 2026)
Complete rewrite of all examples from "scripts to memorize" to "principles to embody"
